Project Overview
This repository provides a complete sound recognition model training framework with:

Environmental sound classification (e.g., dog barks, bee buzz, children playing and so on)

Custom sound category training

End-to-end PyTorch pipeline (preprocessing → training → inference)

Core Features
Data Preprocessing ____ Automatic processing of audio slicing, resampling, spectrum conversion (Mel/MFCC)
Enhancement training ____ Supports 12 kinds of data enhancement such as adding noise, time-frequency mask, and speed modulation.
Model Architecture ____ provides CNN, ResNet, Transformer and other baseline models.
Deployment Support ____ Export ONNX/TFLite format, support mobile and embedded device deployment.

Usage Restrictions
- ✅ **Allowed**: Learning, personal projects, non-commercial forks.  
- ❌ **Prohibited**: Commercial use, redistribution without permission.
